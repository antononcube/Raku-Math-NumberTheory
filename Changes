Changes of the Raku package "Math::NumberTheory".

2026-02-26 0.1.0
    - Major refactoring of the code into meaningful and convenient module-submodule structure.
        - For example, the submodule providing &number-expansion and &from-number-expansion can use the submodule providing &fibonacci.
    - API increment (i.e. ":api<1>".)
        - This means that I think the current subs name-and-signature design is "good and stable."

2026-02-22 0.0.31
    - Refactored &from-continued-fraction to use &from-generalized-continued-fraction.
        - &from-generalized-continued-fraction was previously a multi-sub of &from-continued-fraction.
        - &from-generalized-continued-fraction allows both lazy and non-lazy arguments.
    - Implemented &number-expansion and &from-number-expansion in "Math::NumberTheory::Expansions".
        - That module has to be explicitly loaded in order to use its subs.
        - The number expansions have a specification document: "docs/number-expansion-spec.md".

2026-02-11 0.0.30
    - Implemented &convergents for computation of the convergents of continued fraction terms.
    - Implemented &is-quadratic-irrational with two methods.
        - One based on continued fraction periodicity, the other quadratic polynomial discriminant heuristic.

2026-02-09 0.0.29
    - Made &continued-fraction work over lists.
    - Implemented &quotient and &quotient-reminder over integers, reals, and complex complex numbers.

2026-02-08 0.0.28
    - Continued fractions functions implementation, &continued-fraction and &from-continued-fraction.

2026-01-17 0.0.27
    - Extending &fibonacci to work with negative integers, rationals, complex numbers, and lists of numbers.
    - Implemented &lucas-l for Lucas L-numbers computation.
        - Similar to &fibonacci.

2026-01-06 0.0.26
    - Bug fix: correct &random-prime behaviour.
    - Extended the signature of &random-prime to take :$min and :$max options.
    - The CLI can handle ranges now.

2025-12-27 0.0.25
    - Bug fix: Proper &is-gaussian-prime test (for negative components).
        - One fix is for the application of the built-in &is-prime.
            - The built-in &is-prime always gives False on negative integers.
        - The other fix for the mod application (over a negative component.)

2025-12-22 0.0.24
    - Documentation update: README and sub WHY notes.

2025-12-21 0.0.23
    - Implemented &is-abundant-number, &is-deficient-number, &is-perfect-number, &abundant-number, &deficient-number, &perfect-number.
    - First version of the CLI script number-theory.

2025-12-19 0.0.22
    - Implemented &is-harshad-number.
    - Fix: proper respect of the option :gaussian-integers by &is-prime.

2025-12-17 0.0.21
    - Implemented &integer-partitions.
        - It slow for larger numbers, ≥ 1000.
    - Implemented &integer-digits and &is-happy-number.

2025-05-28 0.0.20
    - Added &is-composite, &is-prime-power, &mangold-lambda, and &are-coprime and related tests.

2025-04-07 0.0.19
    - Faster and more robust &multiplicative-root.
    - Made &power-mod and &primitive-root* to work with a first argument being a list.
